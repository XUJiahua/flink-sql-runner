# Flink SQL Runner

<img src="stdlib-docs/img/runner_logo.png" alt="Flink SQL Runner Logo" width="300" align="right" />

Tools and extensions for running Apache Flink SQL applications, including Docker images, data types, connectors, function libraries, and formats.

This repository contains core components for running Flink SQL applications in production using the Flink Kubernetes Operator, without manual JAR assembly or custom infrastructure.

The individual components are modular and the project is composable to make it easy to create your own custom Flink SQL runner.

## Features

- 📝 **SQL Script Execution**: Run SQL scripts directly with Flink.
- 🧾 **Compiled Plan Execution**: Run pre-compiled Flink SQL plans to manage production deployments and versioning.
- 🔄 **Environment Variable Substitution**: Inject environment variables `${VAR}` into SQL scripts and configs at runtime.
- 📦 **JAR Dependency Management**: Reference local directories with required JARs (e.g. UDFs).
- 🌍 **Kubernetes-Friendly**: Built to run with the Flink Kubernetes Operator.
- 🔧 **Function Infrastructure**: Utilities for writing and loading UDFs as system functions.
- 🪄 **Flink Extensions**:
    - 💀 Dead-letter queue support in Kafka for poison message handling.
    - 🚀 Native JSON and Vector types with JSON format and PostgreSQL connector support.
    - 📚 Function libraries for additional functionality in Flink SQL (advanced math, OpenAI, etc)
    - ⚙️ Additional configuration options for CSV format.

## Flink SQL Runner Usage

You can use the docker image to run Flink SQL scripts or compiled plans locally or in Kubernetes.
The docker image contains the executable flink-sql-runner.jar file which supports the following command line arguments:

| Argument           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-p, --planfile`   | Compiled plan (i.e. JSON file) to execute                                                                                                                                                            |
| `-s, --sqlfile`    | Flink SQL script to execute                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `-c, --config-dir` | Directory containing the [Flink configuration YAML file](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2/docs/deployment/config/)                                                          |
| `-u, --udfpath`    | Path to folder that contains JAR files that implement user defined functions (UDFs) or other runtime extensions for Flink                                                                            |
| `-m, --mode`       | Optional argument to specify [Flink execution mode](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/datastream/execution_mode/) (`STREAMING` (default), `BATCH`, or `AUTOMATIC`) |

> [!WARNING]
> The runner expects either a Flink SQL script or a compiled plan - not both.
> 
> The `--mode` argument - even if it is explicitly set - will be ignored if the Flink YAML configuration set via `--config-dir` contains `execution.runtime-mode`.

We strongly recommend to run compiled plans for production Flink SQL applications since they support
lifecycle management of applications, are stable across Flink versions, and provide more control over
the executed JobGraph.
You can use the [SQRL compiler](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/) to compile Flink SQL applications to compiled plans.

### Running Locally

To run Flink SQL Runner locally using Docker in a self-contained cluster (JobManager and TaskManager in a single container):

1\. Create your SQL script
Put your Flink SQL (e.g., `flink.sql`) in a local directory, such as:

```bash
./sql-scripts/flink.sql
```

2\. Run the Docker image
This starts a full standalone Flink session cluster in one container:

```bash
docker run -d --rm -it \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -v "$PWD/sql-scripts":/flink/sql \
  --name runner \
  datasqrl/flink-sql-runner:0.10.2-flink-2.2 \
  cluster
```

3\. Submit your SQL job
In a separate terminal, run:

```bash
docker exec -it runner sql-runner --sqlfile /flink/sql/flink.sql
```

The job will be submitted to the embedded JobManager and executed using the local TaskManager.

> [!NOTE]  
> The [`sql-runner`](https://github.com/DataSQRL/flink-sql-runner/blob/main/flink-sql-runner/src/main/docker/sql-runner) wrapper submits the runner through `flink run` so you do not need to specify the main class or placeholder JAR manually.
> The placeholder JAR is necessary because `sql-runner.jar` is shipped under Flink's `lib/` fodler, while the Flink CLI still requires a job JAR argument for `flink run`.
> By default, all arguments are passed to the SQL runner, for example `sql-runner --sqlfile /flink/sql/flink.sql`.
> To pass options to `flink run`, put them before `--`; arguments after `--` are passed to the SQL runner, for example `sql-runner -s /path/to/savepoint -- --planfile /flink/plan.json`.
> You can also omit using `sql-runner` and directly use `flink run`, just make sure to pass the main class and use the `noop.jar`.

4\. Inspect output
If your SQL uses the print connector as a sink, you can check logs via:

```bash
docker exec -it runner bash -c "cat /opt/flink/log/$(ls /opt/flink/log | grep 'flink--taskexecutor' | grep '.out')"
```

Or use the Flink UI at http://localhost:8081 to monitor jobs.

### Running in Kubernetes with Flink Operator

Here's how to use the Flink Jar Runner with the Flink Operator on Kubernetes:

1\. Prepare Your Files: Ensure that your SQL scripts (`statements.sql`) or compiled plans (`compiled_plan.json`), and JAR files are accessible within your container.

Example Helm chart configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: flink.apache.org/v1beta1
kind: FlinkDeployment
metadata:
  name: sql-example
spec:
  image: datasqrl/flink-sql-runner:latest
  flinkVersion: v2_2
  flinkConfiguration:
    taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: "1"
  serviceAccount: flink
  jobManager:
    resource:
      memory: "2048m"
      cpu: 1
  taskManager:
    resource:
      memory: "2048m"
      cpu: 1
  job:
    jarURI: http://raw.github.com/datasqrl/releases/0.10.2/flink-sql-runner.jar
    args: ["--sqlfile", "/opt/flink/usrlib/sql-scripts/statements.sql", "--planfile", "/opt/flink/usrlib/sql-scripts/compiled_plan.json", "--udfpath", "/opt/flink/usrlib/jars"]
    parallelism: 1
    upgradeMode: stateless
```

> [!WARNING]
> Configure either the SQL script OR the compiled plan - not both.

1. Deploy with Helm:
```bash
helm install sql-example -f <your-helm-values>.yaml <your-helm-chart>
```

### Environment Variable Substitution

Flink SQL Runner automatically substitutes environment variables in your configuration files, SQL scripts, and compiled plans for secrets and environment specific configuration.
Environment variables must be of the form `${ENV_VARIABLE}` and inside of strings.
They also support bash-style defaults using `${ENV_VARIABLE:-default}` or `${ENV_VARIABLE:=default}`.

For example, `${DATA_PATH}` is an environment variable inside the connector configuration of a table that is substituted at runtime:
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `MyTable` (
  ...
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'filesystem',
  'format' = 'json',
  'path' = '${DATA_PATH}/applications.jsonl',
  'source.monitor-interval' = '1'
);
```

### Default Environment Variables

The Flink SQL Runner automatically provides default values for deployment-specific environment variables if they are not already set in your environment.
The following environment variables are automatically set with default values:

| Variable               | Default Value                | Description                                                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_ID`        | Random UUID                  | A unique identifier for the deployment (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`) |
| `DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP` | Current time in milliseconds | The deployment timestamp in milliseconds since epoch (e.g., `1704067200000`)          |

These defaults are applied at runtime before environment variable substitution occurs, making them available for use in SQL scripts and compiled plans even when not explicitly set in your environment.

Example usage in a SQL script:
```sql
SELECT '${DEPLOYMENT_ID}' AS deployment_id, CAST('${DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP}' AS BIGINT) AS deployment_timestamp;
```

### Building Your Own Flink SQL Runner

The Flink SQL runner is published to Maven Central and you can add it as a dependency in your project to extend
the runner to suit your needs.

- Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datasqrl.flinkrunner</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-sql-runner</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.2</version>
</dependency>
```
- Gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'com.datasqrl.flinkrunner:flink-sql-runner:0.10.2'
```

## Flink Extensions

The Flink SQL Runner contains a few extensions to the Flink runtime.

### Dead-Letter-Queue Support for Kafka Sources

If a Flink SQL application fails to deserialize a message from a Kafka topic, the entire job can fail. 

This project implements the `kafka-safe` and `upsert-kafka-safe` [connectors](connectors/kafka-safe) which extend the respective kafka connectors with dead-letter-queue support, so that messages which fail to deserialize can be logged, or sent to a dead-letter-queue, instead of failing the job.

In addition to the configuration options exposed by the original kafka connectors, the `-safe` versions support the following optional configuration options:

| Options                    | Default | Type   | Description                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|---------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scan.deser-failure.handler | none    | String | Use `log` to output failed messages to the logger, `kafka` to output failed messages to a kafka topic, or `none` to fail the job. |
| scan.deser-failure.topic   | -       | String | The topic for the dead-letter-queue that failed messages are written to. Required when the handler is configured to `kafka`.      |
| scan.rate-limit.records-per-second | - | Long | Maximum number of records per second emitted by the source across all source subtasks. The limit is divided evenly among the parallel subtasks. When unset, rate limiting is disabled. |

> [!NOTE]  
> The dead-letter-queue producer will use the same Kafka configuration that is provided for the Flink SQL table that reads the data.

#### Source Rate Limiting

Both the `kafka-safe` and `upsert-kafka-safe` connectors support throttling how fast records are consumed via the optional `scan.rate-limit.records-per-second` option. This is useful to protect a shared Kafka cluster or a slow downstream system from being overwhelmed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  `order_id` BIGINT,
  `ts` TIMESTAMP(3)
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka-safe',
  'topic' = 'orders',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
  'format' = 'json',
  'scan.rate-limit.records-per-second' = '1000'
);
```

The configured value is the cumulative rate across all source subtasks. For example, with `scan.rate-limit.records-per-second` set to `1000` and a source parallelism of `4`, each subtask is limited to roughly `250` records per second.

### Conflict Handling for PostgreSQL Sinks

The [JDBC connector for PostgreSQL](connectors/postgresql-connector) (`jdbc-sqrl`) supports configurable behavior when an inserted row conflicts with an existing row on the primary key. The action is selected via the following options:

| Options                           | Default | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sink.on-conflict.action           | update  | Enum   | One of `update`, `timestamp`, or `ignore`. Selects how primary-key conflicts are resolved on the sink.                                               |
| sink.on-conflict.timestamp-column | -       | String | The column used to compare incoming and existing rows when the action is `timestamp`. Required when `sink.on-conflict.action` is set to `timestamp`. |

The `sink.on-conflict.action` values map to the following PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT` behaviors:

- `update`: The existing row is overwritten with the incoming row (`ON CONFLICT (...) DO UPDATE SET ...`). This is the default.
- `timestamp`: The existing row is overwritten only if the incoming row's `sink.on-conflict.timestamp-column` value is strictly greater than the existing row's. 
  Otherwise, the conflicting insert is silently skipped, so out-of-order events do not roll back newer state.
- `ignore`: The existing row is kept, and the conflicting insert is silently skipped (`ON CONFLICT (...) DO NOTHING`).


### JSONB Type

This project adds a [binary JSON type](types/json-type) and associated functions for more efficient JSON handling that does not serialize from and to string repeatedly.

Native JSON type support is also extended to the [JSON format](formats/flexible-json-format) called `flexible-json` for writing JSON data as nested documents (instead of strings) as well as the [JDBC connector for PostgreSQL](connectors/postgresql-connector) to write JSON data to JSONB columns.

The binary JSON type is supported by [these system functions](stdlib-docs/system-functions.yml).

### Vector Type

This project adds a native [Vector type](types/vector-type) and associated functions for more efficient handling of vectors (e.g. for content embeddings).

Native Vector type support is also extended to the [JDBC connector for PostgreSQL](connectors/postgresql-connector) to write vector data to vector columns for the `pgvector` extension.

The native vector type is supported by [these system functions](stdlib-docs/system-functions.yml).

### Function Libraries

<img src="stdlib-docs/img/sqrl_functions_logo.png" alt="Flink SQL Runner Logo" width="300" align="right" />

Implementation of Flink SQL and SQRL functions that can be added as user-defined functions (UDFs) to support additional functionality.

* [Math](stdlib-docs/library-functions.yml): Advanced math functions
* [Iceberg](stdlib-docs/library-functions.yml): Helper functions for advanced Iceberg functionality.
* [OpenAI](stdlib-docs/library-functions.yml): Function for calling completions, structured data extraction, and vector embeddings.

## Usage

### Within DataSQRL

If you are using the [DataSQRL framework](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl) to compile your SQRL project, you can import the function library as follows:

`IMPORT stdlib.[library-name].*`

where `[library-name]` is replaced with the name of the library, e.g. `stdlib.math.*`.

To import a single function:

`IMPORT stdlib.[library-name].[function-name]`

e.g. `stdlib.text.split`.

### Flink SQL Runner

To use a function library with the Flink SQL Runner:

1. Copy the JAR file for the function library to the UDF directory that is passed as an argument.
2. Declare the function in your Flink SQL script:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION TheFunctionToAdd AS 'com.datasqrl.flinkrunner.[library-name].[function-name]';
```

where you replace `[library-name]` with the name of the function library and `[function-name]` with the name of the function.

### Custom Flink Implementation

If you are building your own Flink SQL runner, you can depend on the function modules and load the functions into your project.

### CSV Format

The `flexible-csv` format extends the standard csv format with a configuration option `skip-header` to skip the first row in a CSV file (i.e. the header).
